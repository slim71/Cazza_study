# Inverse Kinematics of a "failed" project.
 
 
The Cazza X1 arm has been a project by then-19-year-old **Chris Kelsey**. 
The aim of the project was to design a mobile robotic arm for 3D printing of 
constructions up to 5m in height, with the promise of cutting down time and cost
of buildings with respect to traditional methods.
 
First appeared in 2017, the project quickly gained a high reputation and 
started raising funds, even strucking a deal with the Dubai government to 3D 
print an entire skyscraper. 

Around September 2018, though, the project was practically vanished: reading some
material on the internet, we can find out how Kelsey's cofounder stole about
$1m USD and got away with it.
In subsequent posts and interviews, Kelsey also admitted using another company's
video of a construction 3D printer to promote his own, and that he had lied to
the press about the Cazza equipment being ready.

Inspired by the project, I've tried to recreate some kind of feasible architecture
for the robotic arm. It's not a strict study, nor it's perfect, but here you can
see my results.

This files have been used for the project of the the course of Robot Mechanics, 
part of the Master Degree in [Robotics and Automation Engineering](http://www.aut.ing.unipi.it/),
attended at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/).
